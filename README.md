# ModulaToOberon
Transpiler from Modula-2 to Oberon and Component Pascal

In the second half of the last decade of the last century, I found Niklaus Wirth's Modula to Oberon transpiler as binhex files on some ftp server, most probably it was the ftp server of the GWDG (Gesellschaft f√ºr wissenschaftliche Datenverarbeitung, part of the German Max Planck Society), where it is still (as of 26-Apr-2023) available at this directory https://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/languages/oberon/ftp.inf.ethz.ch/OberonV4/MacII/Sources/ModulaToOberon/.

Nw's original version skips comments and presents syntax errors as error numbers. That was a usual compiler behavior in early Modula-2 times (at least for those compilers written by NW's group).
